# Chip-8

# Introduction

This is my own implementation of the `Chip-8` emulator, which follows the instructions made by [Austin Morlan Site](https://austinmorlan.com/posts/chip8_emulator/).

`Chip-8` is an emulator of 8 bit based programs. It never was a real machine - rather a virtual machine.    \
The `Chip-8` was made to allow early video games to be more easily programmed for these computers.
